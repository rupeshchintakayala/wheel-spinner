# Wheel Spinner

A fun, interactive wheel spinner built with React and Tailwind CSS. Add names to the wheel and spin to pick a winner! 

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Rigged Selection**: Always selects "Yasin" (shh, it's a secret!)
- ðŸŽ¨ **Clean UI**: Modern, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- âš¡ **Fast**: Built with Vite for lightning-fast development
- ðŸš€ **Auto-Deploy**: GitHub Actions pipeline for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages

## Getting Started

## Deployment

### Setup GitHub Pages Deployment

2. Go to your repository settings
3. Navigate to "Pages" in the sidebar

## How It Works

The wheel spinner includes a special "rigged" algorithm that ensures "Yasin" is always selected as the winner, regardless of the spin. The wheel still spins realistically and appears random to observers!
